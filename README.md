modcov
======

A tool to check every module's code coverage. Usually we run tests & measurement
code coverage for whole project. There is a question: some module will have a low
code coverage.

This tool use the exists coverage data to check every changed module's code coverage,
and exit with a non-zero status code if the module's code coverage less than specified.

## Install

```shell
$ pip install -U modcov
```

## Example

After tests & measurement code coverage:

```shell
$ modcov --fail-under=75 pkg/handler/demo.py
```

Check the modules that changed in last commit in git:

```shell
$ modcov --fail-under=75 --git
```

Exclude tests:

```shell
$ modcov --fail-under=75 --git --exclude=tests/*
```
